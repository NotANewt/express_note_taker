## Installation

This app requires installation of express and uuid to function. Both can be installed from npmjs.com using the following inputs:

```bash
npm i express
```

```bash
npm i uuid
```

## Usage

When the application is opened, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When they click on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top right of the page. When they click on the Save icon, then the new note they entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column. When they click on the Write icon (+) in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When the user clicks on the delete icon (trashcan) on the righthand side of each note, that note is deleted.
